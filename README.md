## POMODORO TECHNIQUE SCRIPT ##

**AUTHOR:** Jack Wiebe
**DATE: March 15, 2018**

A linux-terminal script for running a pomodoro timer for the eponymous
management technique. 

The defining feature is the use of a visual queue in the form of dimming the
screen to signal when to take breaks or return to work. From personal experience
with other pomodoro timers, sound or notifications alone can be easily
ignored. By introducing a visual queue the physically prevents you from
continuing the work without some effort it is easier in my experience to switch
into 'break mode'.
